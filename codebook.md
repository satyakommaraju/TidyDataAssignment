Explanation of Variables and their calculations used for the script.

mean(): Mean value std(): Standard deviation mad(): Median absolute deviation
max(): Largest value in array min(): Smallest value in array sma(): Signal magnitude area energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
iqr(): Interquartile range
entropy(): Signal entropy arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4 
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals 
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors. The angle variables: variables composed of means.
